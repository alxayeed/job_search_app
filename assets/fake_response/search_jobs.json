Think solar, roofing, and real estate sales reps.\n\nThey talk to customers face to face, our mobile app records their conversations, and our AI automatically transcribes and analyzes their conversations to help them improve their sales.\n\nOur vision is to bring the power of conversation intelligence from the Zoom meeting and the call center to the more than 10M sales people who work offline.\n\nWe’re growing 20% MoM, have dozens of customers including Fortune 500 companies, Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone’s, and we are profitable!\n\nWe’re backed by Byron Deeter (one of the best investors in history) from Bessemer Venture Partners, the top Cloud investor in the world.

Someone who deeply cares about delighting customers and solving their pains, not about vanity metrics.\n• 🏅 A quality obsessive. Someone who deeply cares about our users and the quality of their work. Our customers are not tech companies. They’re people who live and work in the real world.

You love giving and receiving feedback, and learning and growing as a team.\n• 📈 Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.\n\nThe Role\n\nYou will be a part of the founding team in one of the fastest growing startups in the world. As we scale, we need a mobile engineer who can build a high-quality mobile application quickly. You will collaborate with everyone at Rillavoice, even our customers, to deliver a world-class solution.\n\nRillavoice’s mobile app is built in React Native, with most of our user base on iOS. Our backend is Node.js in Typescript. You will take ownership of the mobile application and help build out the mobile team as we scale the company.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n• Build high-quality products very fast.\n• Define the features to work on and build them from scratch as we push forward our technical roadmap.\n• Have empathy for our users and build solutions for them. And you’ll be able to do this without any explicit planning or expectations.\n• Push for a high bar for the quality of our codebase and our technical decisions. You’ll help in setting the standard for the future as we scale the engineering organization here at Rillavoice.\n• Define the processes around mobile app development.\n• Architect the mobile app to provide a fast and amazing user experience.\n• Help recruit future engineers to expand the team.\n\nWhat you bring\n• 5+ years experience in building software, with at least 3 years in building mobile applications in React Native, ideally some of it in startups\n• Ability to move fast and iterate quickly\n• A customer-first mindset and an interest in talking with customers to make sure what we’re building meets their needs\n• Experience owning technically challenging projects\n• Bonus points if you have experience in mentoring engineers and interviewing!\n\nCompensation\n\nOur compensation philosophy is that we always pay top of market - above the 90th percentile. This means that whatever you’re getting paid currently, or whatever the market is willing to pay you, we’ll pay you more. 😄",

Currently, we have built a collaborative AI agent called Postbot that helps users use natural language to automate key use cases in writing tests, visualizations of responses, and documentation. We know this work is valuable because Postbot has been highly adopted in these use cases but we also know we’ve just scratched the surface of the potential we have with AI to enrich the lives of millions of developers.\nWe are first going to more deeply integrate AI into these surface areas with key interaction patterns inspired by AI-first editors like Cursor, Copilot, and others. We need someone who deeply understands these interaction patterns that drive developer delight and how AI can be used to make the Postman developer experience faster and more efficient.\nJoin us, and help shape, build, and deliver the future of AI at Postman. We expect this role to not just be doing what you’re told, but to be actively exploring, learning, and proposing substantive improvements to our product experience and how AI fits in. Your opportunity is to embody the quote below by Alan Kay and help us invent the future.\n“The best way to predict the future is to invent it”– Alan Kay\nWho are we\nPostman is the world’s leading API platform, used by more than 30 million developers and 500,000 organizations, including 98% of the Fortune 500. Postman is helping developers and professionals across the globe build the API-first world by simplifying each step of the API lifecycle and streamlining collaboration—enabling users to create better APIs, faster.\nThe company is headquartered in San Francisco and has an office in Bangalore, where it was founded. Postman is privately held, with funding from Battery Ventures, BOND, Coatue, CRV, Insight Partners, and Nexus Venture Partners. Learn more at postman.com or connect with Postman on Twitter via @getpostman.\nP.S: We highly recommend reading The \"API-First World\" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture and our vision at Postman.\nWhat you’ll do\nThe team that builds Postbot is small, but mighty, so what you do day-over-day and week-over-week may vary and evolve as we continue to iterate in a fast-moving space in AI. This being said, we are looking for an engineer who is capable, curious, and motivated to shape and implement the integration strategy of AI to a mature, well-loved, and ubiquitous developer product in Postman.You should expect to:\n\nOwn and deliver. Deliver improvements to the core product experience that help us achieve our goals around onboarding and activation\n\nInnovate and experiment. Lead experiments with new AI-driven features, iterating quickly on prototypes to validate ideas and gather feedback, while keeping an eye on emerging trends and technologies in the AI space\n\nMore deeply integrate AI. Postbot is a useful experience right now, but to make it more useful, we need to integrate it in key surfaces like the script editor and documentation editor and establish best-in-class integration patterns in doing so\nOwn end-to-end workflows. Own end-to-end and understand core workflows, driving measurable improvements to user experience particularly focused on first-time user experience (sign-up, onboarding, and beyond)\nDeeply understand the user. Collaborate and work with end users (developers!) using Postman to understand their core workflows and then use that knowledge to improve our product\nLearn and grow. Broaden your knowledge of the core product and the domain over time, starting with Postbot’s integration strategy and in doing so expand to complete product knowledge and ability to make and influence changes across key products in the Postman user journey in API client, collections, and workspaces\nCollaborate across boundaries and geographies. Collaborate on team processes to streamline collaboration across US and India team members\n\nAbout you:\nMust have:\n\nMUST HAVE: Cloud and AI knowledge and awareness. AI, GenAI, Machine Learning and at least familiarity with one of the major clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure)\nDepth and quality of experience is more important than number of years, but typically a good target is that you have at least 3+ years of experience with machine learning projects.\nExpertise in building the modern web with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You likely have used libraries or frameworks like React or Next.js, but we care much more about the fundamentals than the tech stack.\nTrack record of delivering impactful and engaging user experiences that delight users.\nExcellent communication skills. We’re a remote-first team and we’re going to be moving fast together. Good communication is key.\nDetail oriented. We have to care about the details, and while we don’t expect you to be a designer, you need to care about the product experience that our teams are shipping.\nCustomer obsession. As we are a core product with years of muscle memory, we need an engineer who is able and willing to leverage the voice of the customer to expedite decision making, develop conviction, and most importantly delight our user.\nBased in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nNice-to-have:\n\nExperience delivering AI-augmented features to established products\nExperience with building or fine-tuning LLMs, RAG, or prompt engineering\nExperience working with or using full-stack JavaScript / TypeScript\nExperience working in a React application\nExperience working on B2B product and/or developer tools\n\nOur values:\nAt Postman, we create with the same curiosity that we see in our users. We value transparency & honest communication about not only successes, but also failures. In our work, we focus on specific goals that add up to a larger vision. Our inclusive work culture ensures that everyone is valued equally as important pieces of our final product. We are dedicated to delivering the best products we can.\nWhat else?\nIf the role is based in the greater San Francisco area, and the reasonably estimated salary for this role ranges from $177,607 to $240,292, plus a competitive equity package.

      "job_description": "Laurel’s Mission to Return Time:\n\nWe’re a team that is connected by time. Life has taught us its true value and finite nature. We value every minute and are on a mission to return time. And we live and breathe that mission in everything we do — from how we build our product that saves our customers time to how we operate as a company.\n\nCome work with a team that’s intelligent yet humble, visionary yet gets things done. A team that’s only getting started at cracking a problem that affects every person who uses a screen to work.\n\nCome build a company that will stand the test of time as we look to understand time itself.\n\nWe all waste a staggering amount of time at work (~33%) because we have no idea where we are spending it. Worse yet, we continue to operate in a factory model that simply does not apply to creative work. Our big bet is that by understanding time, we’ll be able to move away from it as a unit of value. In the future knowledge economy (lawyers, accountants, engineers), contributions will be assessed on value added, not the underlying time spent adding it.\n\nAmbitious mission to say the least, so where are we starting? We have created a new market category called Time Automation that automates the timekeeping process for professionals and allows us to collect time data at scale. Before Laurel, professionals had to manually record every six minutes of their day into antiquated timekeeping software. Not anymore. We are moving away from a world in which humans tell a machine what they did at work, to our version of the world in which the machine tells the human.\n\nWe are looking for individuals who share our passion of returning time. Come join us on our journey as we spend time solving time. It will be a long road but if we’re even half right, we’ll change the way work is measured and performed forever.\n\nJob Description\n(est. reading time: 5 mins)\n\nLaurel's mission is about returning time.

Your ability to learn quickly, write, and design quality software will serve you well in delivering value to our customers incrementally. Ownership comes from the ground up, we empower our teams to understand and make an impact on the business.\n\nWhy Now?\n\nAI will fundamentally change the nature of work, and how we think about work.

We've built a product that people like, and have a direction that people love, but it hasn't been done yet.\nCore Duties\n• Architect and Develop: Design, build, and maintain efficient, reusable, and reliable code across both frontend and backend components of our web applications.\n• Collaborate: Work closely with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers, and other engineers, to gather requirements, define technical specifications, and deliver high-quality software solutions.\n• Optimize: Identify bottlenecks and bugs, and devise solutions to mitigate and address these issues. Continuously improve performance, scalability, and security of our applications.\n• Mentor: Provide technical guidance and mentorship to junior developers, fostering a culture of learning and growth within the team.\n• Innovate: Stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies, and proactively suggest improvements and new features to enhance our products.\n• Test and Deploy: Implement automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure robust and reliable software releases.\n• Work with Product and Customer Success teams to flesh out business requirements and designs for those requirements and systems\nTeammates\n\nThis role will report to our VP of Engineering and work alongside our Engineering team members.\nSkills and Experience\n• Education: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience.\n• Experience: 5+ years of professional experience in software development, with a focus on full stack development.\n• Technical Skills:\n• Frontend: Proficiency in modern frontend technologies such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. Strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n• Backend: Experience with backend frameworks such as Node.js, Django, or similar. Proficient in server-side languages like JavaScript (Node.js), Python, C++ or Java.\n• Problem-Solving: Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to think critically and creatively. Ability to work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and manage multiple priorities.\n• Communication: Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment.\n• Customer Mindset: Proven ability to engage with customers and understand their needs.\n• Domain Knowledge: Experience in AI, is strongly preferred.\nFlexibility and Logistics:\n• Location: While we would prefer this role be located in our San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York offices, we will consider remote candidates located within the United States.\n• Compensation: Competitive salary, generous equity, comprehensive medical/dental/vision coverage with covered premiums, 401(k), additional benefits including wellness/commuter/FSA stipends; For candidates located in New York and California, the range for this role is $150,000-$215,000 USD. Final compensation amounts will be determined based on several factors including candidate experience, technical qualifications and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed.\n• Visa Sponsorship: Unfortunately we are unable to sponsor visas at this time.\n• What happens if my kid or I are sick on a workday? Take all the time you need! We’ll cover for you. And send you some soup.\n\nNot sure if you meet the qualifications?

We recruit nationally and provide financial relocation assistance.\n\nCode that saves lives.\n\nAs a software developer at Epic, you’ll write software that impacts the lives of 75% of Americans and 300 million patients around the world. Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.\n\nWrite software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.\n\nThe top-ranked health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers. Our community includes major systems like the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente, as well as leading academic medical centers at the University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, University of California, University of Texas, The Ohio State University, and many more.\n\nExperience our state-of-the-art campus, eat delicious food, and travel the world.\n\nWe don’t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they exist, but…) Our uniquely themed campus was designed to heighten your ability to get stuff done in your office, a conference room, or by the fireplace in a comfy chair. For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyoncé concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.\n\nLive affordably in a city known for its rising tech talent.\n\nEpic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin, which is the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States, home to the state capital, and the University of Wisconsin. Madison has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison’s first arcade bar.\n\nMore than just important work.\n\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to keep you healthy and happy as you grow in your life and career, and your merit-based compensation will reflect the impact your work has on the company and our customers. You'll also be eligible for annual raises and bonuses, as well as stock grants, which give you an even greater stake in the success of Epic and our customers. Healthcare is global, and building the best ideas from around the world into Epic software is a point of pride. As an Equal Opportunity Employer, we know that inclusive teams design software that supports the delivery of quality care for all patients, so diversity, equity, and inclusion are written into our principles. Research has shown that job-seekers who are women, LGBTQ+, or members of historically underrepresented communities are less likely to apply for roles they don't seem completely qualified for, so we encourage all who are interested to apply.

Despite being a small team, our compute platform is built using the largest Aurora/Mesos clusters in the world. Therefore we need to build software that is highly scalable, reliable, cost efficient, and operationally automated. We also have a more nascent Kubernetes platform, which in the long run we’d like to transition towards. However, this comes with significant technical challenges given the maturity and scale of our current Aurora/Mesos clusters; we would be running one of the largest Kubernetes environments in the world. Who You Are: We are looking for talented engineers who draw motivation from building infrastructure and platforms that help others be more productive.

You favor sustainable, scalable, and automation-focused approaches to the systems you design and build. You’re comfortable iterating quickly and experimenting when exploring a new problem, but you know when and how to invest in automating and documenting your work so it’s discoverable and useful to others. You are curious and driven to understand new technical spaces and problems. You are an engaged and thoughtful collaborator, ready to solve challenging problems with your peers. Quality and reliability are key pillars in your software engineering philosophy. What You’ll Do: In this role, you will: Participate in building and operating the mission-critical compute infrastructure that powers X. Participate in systems review processes, growing into system design contributions. Actively engage in knowledge sharing - great documentation is really important, and we should have that for the folks who operate the platform, and for the customers who rely on our product. Qualifications: Proficiency in languages like Java, C++, Python, Golang, Scala Experience with cluster management and containerization technologies is very helpful (e.g. kubernetes, docker, mesos, borg) Independent learning capabilities for new technologies Extremely committed, willing to work in a fast paced environment Excellent communication and interpersonal skills At X, things will never be boring—we offer tough, but exciting challenges, meaningful tasks and the chance to have real impact on what is bound to evolve into the ultimate everything app. Chat with our Recruiting team to learn more about available roles and opportunities at X. We build the world's most trusted public town square—and we pride ourselves on our commitment to protecting free speech within the boundaries of the law. Beyond that, we aim to increase unregretted user minutes on our platform, and make it the best place on the internet for creators to share content and make money.",

It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.\n\nCreating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.\n\nOur new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.\n\nPinterest is one of the fastest growing online advertising platforms and our continued success depends on rapidly scaling our core revenue-generating systems. Specifically, we need 10X the scale of our campaign management, ad delivery, and machine learning platforms, while enabling developers inside Pinterest and external advertisers to build and iterate rapidly on new features. We are looking for multiple staff engineers to initiate, design, and build the next-gen version of key infra components in our monetization ecosystem, such as modernizing an end-to-end ML platform serving over hundreds of use cases making billions of predictions per second, and redesigning our catalog ingestion and ads delivery systems to become one of the leading advertising platforms in the world. These roles are exciting, because you will be able to lean on your deep infra knowledge to redesign systems to handle a much bigger scale, while also having the chance to work with very experienced engineers and cross-functional partners.\n\nWhat you'll do:\n• Re-architect core catalog, ads indexing and serving infrastructure to achieve greater scalability, freshness, performance, and reliability, using data storage, streaming processing, and information retrieval technologies such as MySQL, TiDB, Flink, and HNSW.\n• Modernize the ML ecosystem for the entire Pinterest Ads product, replacing a hodgepodge of out-of-date ML models with a unified, modern, and privacy-first ML stack with Pytorch, Spark, Iceberg, and GPU based serving.\n• Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define problems and drive solutions.\n• Work with a strong team of engineers and provide technical guidance and mentorship.\n\nWhat we're looking for:\n• 6+ years of relevant industry experience with distributed systems, transactional datastores, and systems programming.\n• Experience in building and owning large scale high performance infrastructure powering ads, recommendation, search, or other consumer facing applications.\n• Experience solving end-user problems and envisioning solutions to improve their productivity.\n• Proficiency in Java, C++, or Python.\n\nRelocation Statement:\n• This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.\n\nIn-Office Requirement Statement\n• We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.\n• This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration one time per week, and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from one of the following offices San Francisco, Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York City.\n\n#LI-CL5\n\n#LI-REMOTE\n\nAt Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee. In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity. Final salary is based on a number of factors including location, travel, relevant prior experience, or particular skills and expertise.\n\nInformation regarding the culture at Pinterest and benefits available for this position can be found here.\n\nUS based applicants only\n$188,847—$330,146 USD\n\nOur Commitment to Diversity:\nPinterest is an equal opportunity employer and makes employment decisions on the basis of merit.

Apply via Dice today!\n\nCompany Overview\n\nWe are a fast-growing tech startup revolutionizing the MSP industry with our innovative Robotic Process Automation platform. Our cutting-edge integrations are disrupting traditional paradigms and transforming the way IT Service Providers operate. We are passionate about empowering our customers to achieve success through connected technology.\n\nAbout You\n\nAs a full stack engineer focused on building new features, you're comfortable creating something out of nothing. You can talk to product stakeholders, record requirements, and ask the right questions where things are ambiguous. You want to create and innovate , and you're comfortable coming up with your best interpretation of a feature or functionality. You understand that the business is relying on you to create \"the next big thing\", and sometimes the business needs that fast . That doesn't mean being sloppy or creating a ton of technical debt but, it does mean prioritizing \"working\" over \"perfection\", and you have the experience and foresight to know where cutting corners is acceptable. You like being the star of the show and having your name tied to feature releases and you're okay with having a deadline to deliver. You want your work to be showcased to hundreds of people on release, and you're able to make that initial release successful for 90% of customers without needing to go through a complete refactor or rebuild in the future. You're comfortable leading initiatives big and small. It might be a new feature added onto something existing that you're able to do yourself, or it might be something bigger that requires multiple engineers and you're comfortable leading and collaborating with others on the technical side to reach the end goal.\n\nYou're a results driven developer who loves greenfields or semi-greenfields and you're not afraid to have an opinion and craft a feature the way you think is best for users when not provided explicit, detailed, direction. You love getting the new idea into users hands as fast as possible.\n\nOur Tech Stack\n• AWS\n• Docker\n• GraphQL\n• Kubernetes\n• Kafka\n• NextJS\n• NodeJS\n• PostgreSQL\n• Python\n• React\n• Redis\n\nRequirements\n• 5+ years experience working as a full stack developer writing modern Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.\n• Experience with Kafka and Redis or similar technologies.\n• Experience with relational databases and SQL, preferably PostgreSQL. You can design database tables and debug slow queries.\n• You know how to write modular, reusable, clean, code that can be easily tested; and you write the tests to go with it.\n• You are a champion of modern python features such as async/await, type-hints, data classes, and pydantic.\n• You are familiar with modern cloud service providers, such as AWS or Azure.\n• You know how to use REST APIs to communicate with external services.\n• You are able to take ownership, make decisions, and create value for a project with minimal input and oversight.\n• You are self-motivated and really want to work on a startup team where you'll be given a lot of responsibility and autonomy.\n• You can reference existing features and design language to build something new without a mockup.\n• You focus on shipping working solutions for end users. You click the buttons in the UI and test the feature you're working on from the user perspective and make improvements to the UX as you see fit.\n\nAbove and Beyond\n• You have worked at a startup before and are excited to try new things and help outside your core domain.\n• Knowledge or experience with workflow building tools, low code tools, or robotic process automation tools.\n• Experience with advanced backend concepts such as cyclic graphs, state machines, postgres optimization, or distributed systems\n• Experience with advanced frontend technologies such as canvas and drag and drop wysiwyg development\n\nFull Stack Software Engineer",

      "job_description": "About Normal Computing\n\nNormal is a New York-based deep-tech startup founded by former engineers from Google Brain, Alphabet X, and Palantir. Our investors include Celesta Capital, First Spark Ventures, Micron and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. We engage with enterprise companies across various industries, including financial services, semiconductors, and the public sector, to deliver cutting-edge AI solutions.\n\nWe build AI systems that natively reason, so they can partner with us on our most important problems.\n\nOur products serve as critical full-stack infrastructure for our enterprise users in deploying AI into high-stakes applications. We are addressing the challenges of reliability, adaptivity, and auditability, which have traditionally been central barriers to adoption.\n\nWe believe that the untapped potential of AI to create transformative value remains to be fully realized. Thus far, AI has been subject to technological limitations such as unpredictable factual errors in generative AI (known as hallucinations) or lack of auditability as black-box models. Consequently, these limitations restrict the application of AI primarily to consumer-grade, low-stakes generative AI workflows and basic pattern recognition systems.\n\nWe envision that true transformative value can be unlocked in enterprise-grade, high-stakes AI workflows, where AI can reason reliably and autonomously, and understand its own limits. In these contexts, AI has the capacity to drive meaningful outcomes with real, complex impact.\n\nOur approach involves redesigning AI systems from the ground up, contrasting other surface-level approaches. Our AI application development platform is powered by novel full-stack probabilistic machine learning infrastructure driven by thermodynamic physics. With Normal's probabilistic AI, we offer unprecedented control over reliability, adaptivity, and auditability to AI models, specifically tailored for critical and customer-specific enterprise workflows.\n\nAs we forge ahead with our mission, we are seeking passionate individuals eager to collaborate with our uniquely diverse and interdisciplinary team, and motivated by a workplace where the hardest problems remain to be solved.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nAs a Senior Full-Stack Engineer at Normal Computing, you will play a key role in developing and maintaining our cutting-edge full-stack AI platform.

We encourage you to apply to this role if you feel you would be a good fit, even if you do not meet all of the requirements listed.\n\nThis role will receive a competitive salary + benefits + equity.\n\nNY Base Pay Range: $150,000-$215,000\n\nA variety of factors are considered when determining someone’s compensation–including a candidate’s professional background, experience, and location.

      "job_description": "Censys knows the internet and cloud better than anyone else. Attack Surface Management provides customers with an attacker-centric view of all externally facing internet and cloud to extend visibility, prioritize, and remediate the most critical risk exposures that will actually lead to a breach. Our daily IPv4 scans and the world’s largest SSL/TLS Certificate database enable customers with the most accurate and continuously updated attack surfaces. Enterprise security teams leverage Censys to keep pace with the speed of the business and gain an advantage over the rapidly evolving cyber-attack threats.\n\nWe’re seeking a Senior Software Engineer, Streaming Attribution to join our team. Our Internet Intelligence Platform is the growth product for Censys and it relies on us having a world-class Streaming Attribution engine for the most real-time solution in the industry. Our ability to correctly attribute internet entities (hostnames, IP addresses, etc.) to the correct organization is the foundation. It will require someone who has both deep internet knowledge and experience to build a highly scalable streaming attribution engine. In addition to deep internet domain knowledge, the candidate will have experience in data pipelines, stream/batch processing at scale, and building out APIs.\n\nWe expect all of our employees to consider customer happiness as our primary goal and a willingness to come to work every day with a great attitude, both eager to learn and educate, which helps to make us a better organization every day.\nWhy Censys Sticks Out:\n• Humble Brilliance: We celebrate intelligence and foster a culture where tackling cybersecurity challenges is exciting and rewarding.\n• A Mosaic of Minds: Our diverse team brings together various talents and backgrounds, fostering true innovation through diverse perspectives.\n• Thinkers and Tinkerers: At Censys, we encourage questioning the status quo, experimenting, and pushing boundaries to drive breakthroughs.\n• Coffee-Fueled Collaboration: Collaboration is at the heart of our success, fueled by a shared passion for disrupting the cybersecurity scene.\n• Trailblazing Impact: Your innovations at Censys make waves in real-world cybersecurity, shaping the future and leaving a lasting legacy.\n• Life Beyond the Firewall: We prioritize work-life balance and support your well-being inside and outside the office.\n• Empowered Voices: Your voice matters at Censys; we champion an inclusive culture where diverse perspectives drive change.\nWhat you’ll do:\n• This role has 2 parts. First, you will research solutions to increase attribution coverage and reduce false positives. Second, you will help implement those solutions as code in the Streaming Attribution data pipeline.\n• You will be using and exploring multiple technologies, often being the first to try a new platform or architectural design.\n• Develop “pivot” microservices to find potential paths that can be attributed. For example, one might be certificate domains to IP addresses.\n• Design automated solutions for building, testing, monitoring, and deploying applications in a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) environment.\n• Maintain a strong customer focus, prioritizing customer feature requests and helping define the Streaming Attribution roadmap.\nWhat you’ll bring:\n• A positive attitude biased towards action and iterative problem solving, learning as we grow every step of the way.\n• A deep understanding of internet data and how internet asset attribution to a company might work. For example, WHOIS, Certificate Subject Alternative Names (SANs), and DNS record types should not be foreign to you.\n• 3+ years of experience building out scalable data pipelining solutions across billions of records.\n• 5+ years of experience with common data-oriented programming languages, such as Golang, Python, and Scala.\n• 3+ years of experience with continuous integration and continuous delivery tools and methodologies.\n• Experience with REST/GRPC and service-oriented architectures.\n• The ability to thoughtfully participate in technical discussions and drive towards data-driven decisions amidst ambiguity and competing priorities.\n• Strong communication and documentation skills. Explaining complex technical concepts to other engineers, designers, salespeople, and content marketers is no problem for you.\nSkills that set you apart:\n• A cyber security engineering background with existing knowledge of helpful data sets and services that could be used for attribution.\n• You have experience with multiple streaming and batch processing solutions such as Spark, Flink, GCP Dataproc, microservice-based designs with GCP PubSub, etc, and know their tradeoffs.\n• You understand the value of building maintainable software. Some of your first tasks when building a new service are ensuring test coverage enforced by CI, adding linters, and adding code complexity checks. You enjoy a good abstraction, and promote established design patterns, but also know when to think outside the box.\n\nOur target salary range for this role is between $160,000 - $190,000 USD + bonus eligibility and equity.\n\nWe are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, however we are open to hiring this position fully remote, with travel opportunities to meet customers and connect with colleagues.\n\nDon't meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they feel they meet every qualification. At Censys we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace - so if you're excited about this role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every listed requirement in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be exactly who we need to fill this role or others!\n\nWe value diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. Censys is an equal opportunity employer.",
